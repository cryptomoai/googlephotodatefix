# Google Photos Date Fix
Purpose: Add timestamp to photos and videos in Google Photos takeout
The project relies on exiftools from https://exiftool.org/
The code reads timestamp from the json files in Google Photos takeout and add it to the jpg and mp4 files, so that these files can show properly in the timeline of other album apps.
